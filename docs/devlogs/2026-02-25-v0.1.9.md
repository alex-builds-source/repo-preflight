# repo-preflight v0.1.9 shipped

## What shipped
- Made `diff_object_sizes` base/target tree-aware for PR diffs, including rename/copy-aware path handling.
- Added optional repeatable check groups for faster runs: `--check-group foundation|docs|secrets|size|diff`.
- Added regression and runtime tests; suite now 25 passing tests.

## Why it matters
- PR gating becomes more reliable for edge cases where blob sizes differ across base and target trees.
- Local developer loops are faster because you can run only the risk area you care about.

## Validation
- Tests: 25 passed
- Secret scan: clean (baseline unchanged)
